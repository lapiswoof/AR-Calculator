# AR-Calculator
Quick python Adventure Rank calculator for genshin impact
# How it works
The calculator takes into account that you are doing your daily commissions and resin. 
It will ask you for input on your current AR, Current EXP, Desired AR, and how much resin you use in a day.
It will then calculate the EXP you need and approximately how many days it'll take before you get there if you are on top of your dailies.
